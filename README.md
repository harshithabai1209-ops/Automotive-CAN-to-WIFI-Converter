üöó Automotive CAN-to-WiFi Converter(PCB DESIGN)
üìå Overview

This project implements an Automotive CAN (Controller Area Network) to Wi-Fi converter using a microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and a custom PCB designed in KiCad.
It allows vehicles‚Äô CAN bus data (speed, RPM, fuel level, sensor data, etc.) to be captured, processed, and transmitted over Wi-Fi to mobile apps.

üöÄ Features
